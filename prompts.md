In this project, I used ChatGPT to understand HTML, CSS, and basic website structure.
ChatGPT helped me with prompts for navbar design, buttons, and layout ideas.
I also used ChatGPT to implement dark mode and responsive design.
It was useful in fixing code errors and styling issues.
Overall, ChatGPT was used for learning, practice, and improving the project.
